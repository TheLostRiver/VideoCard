# Session Context Record

## Mandatory Continuation Rule

After any context compression, resume, interruption, or long-running task handoff, read this file before making decisions or editing files.

This file is not optional. It is the local source of truth for current execution context when conversation history becomes unreliable.

## User Iron Law

The user explicitly required:

1. Implementation work must be split into many atomic tasks.
2. Each atomic task must be small enough to avoid context overflow.
3. Before context becomes too full, the current task state must be recorded here.
4. After context compression, this file must be read first, then work continues from the recorded state.

## Current Task

Task: Task 0.1 - Create Session Context Record

Status: complete; commit/push pending for Task 0.1.

## Current Date

2026-04-30

## Current Branch

`main`

## Active Architecture Direction

The project is migrating from a GPU-only static ladder to a multi-hardware platform.

Core model:

- `HardwareCategory` defines GPU, desktop CPU, mobile CPU, mobile SoC, Apple Silicon, and future categories.
- `MetricDefinition` defines specs, benchmarks, power, gaming, platform, and comparison fields.
- `MetricValue` stores hardware parameter values and enables field-level source/confidence.
- `RankingProfile` defines ladder scoring口径.
- `RankingScore` stores per-item score for a ranking profile.
- `HardwareRepository` is the storage interface.
- JSON repository remains the short-term adapter.
- PostgreSQL repository becomes the long-term adapter.
- Category schema drives list UI, detail UI, admin form, filters, sort options, and compare presets.

## Current Files Changed In This Task

- Modified `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-30-multi-hardware-platform-implementation-GPT-5-Codex.md`
- Modified `SessionContextRecord.md`
- Modified `PROJECT_STATE.md`

## Next Step

1. Commit and push Task 0.1.
2. Start Task 1.1 only after push succeeds.

## Verification Status

Task 0.1 verification passed.

Latest result:

- command: `npm.cmd run verify`
- data validation: `Validated 12 GPU records.`
- tests: 31 pass / 0 fail

## Important Commands

```powershell
npm.cmd run verify
git status -sb
git diff --stat
```

## Continuation Instructions

If resuming after compression:

1. Read this file.
2. Read `PROJECT_STATE.md`.
3. Read the implementation plan.
4. Check `git status -sb`.
5. Continue from `Next Step`.

Do not start Task 1.1 until the Task 0.1 commit has been pushed to `origin main`.
